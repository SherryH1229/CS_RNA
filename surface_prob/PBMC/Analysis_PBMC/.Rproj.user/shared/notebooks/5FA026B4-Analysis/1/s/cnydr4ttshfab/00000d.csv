"2","the rlog assumes that data is close to a negative binomial distribution, an assumption
which is sometimes not compatible with datasets where many genes have many zero counts
despite a few very large counts.
In this data, for 22.1% of genes with a sum of normalized counts above 100, it was the case 
that a single sample's normalized count made up more than 90% of the sum over all samples.
the threshold for this warning is 10% of genes. See plotSparsity(dds) for a visualization of this.
We recommend instead using the varianceStabilizingTransformation or shifted log (see vignette)."
